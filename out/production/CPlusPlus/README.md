# 🔁 Coding Revival - 2025

Welcome! This repository marks my **fresh start in 2025** as I return to coding with new energy and focus. After exploring various programming languages in the past, especially C++ and Python, I'm now challenging myself to improve, learn, and build consistently.

## 🚀 What's This Repository About?

This repo serves as a collection of my **recent and future coding work**, created as part of my personal coding revival challenge. The goal is to build small projects, solve problems, and polish my programming skills.

### 🔹 Key Points:
- Relearning and practicing **C++**, **Python**, and other languages.
- Writing clean, efficient, and structured code.
- Staying consistent and building daily or weekly.

## 🧠 Why This Challenge?

In the past, I worked on several interesting coding problems and assignments. However, I left some of that behind.

Now in **2025**, I'm back to coding again – stronger, focused, and more determined.

> "**Note**: I’ve left behind a lot of old code that meant a lot to me. But now, it’s time to move forward."
